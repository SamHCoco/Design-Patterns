# OOP Design Patterns

### Introduction
Software patterns are industry standard "best practice" templates for solving frequently occurring problems.

They fall into 3 categories:

**Creational**: Design patterns for instantiating objects.

**Structural**: Design patterns for how classes and objects can be composed.

**Behavioural**: Design patterns for handling interaction between objects.

### Creational Design Patterns

##### Singleton
This pattern ensures that only a single instance of a class is ever instantiated during an application's runtime.

##### Factory
This pattern is used when a method needs to return an instance of one of several sub-classes that all share the same super class, but we do not know ahead of time which sub class (for example, this could be determined by user input).
